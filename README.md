**Q.** How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

**A.** Interpreting user needs begins with understanding the problem from the user’s perspective. This often involves gathering requirements, asking clarifying questions, and identifying what features provide the most value. User stories are a key tool in this process because they frame requirements in terms of user goals rather than technical details. By writing stories in the format “As a [user], I want [functionality], so that [goal],” I can focus on building features that directly address real needs. This also helps ensure that development remains user-centered and prioritizes value over unnecessary complexity.

**Q.** How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

**A.** When developing programs, I break down large problems into smaller, manageable tasks. Agile processes such as iterative development, sprint planning, and retrospectives help me stay organized and continuously improve. I especially value the feedback loop created by sprint reviews, where progress is demonstrated and stakeholders can provide input. In my future work, I hope to continue using Agile practices like daily stand-ups, backlog grooming, and retrospectives to ensure steady progress, adaptability, and collaboration with my team.

**Q.** What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

**A.** Being a good team member means more than just writing good code. It requires clear communication, accountability, and a willingness to collaborate. Good team members actively listen to others, provide constructive feedback, and support their teammates when challenges arise. In Agile development, this also means being flexible and open to change, since priorities can shift quickly. Ultimately, a good team member contributes not only to the success of the project but also to a positive and productive team environment.
